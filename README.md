# Data Visualization

## Overview
This project provides examples and techniques for visualizing data using popular Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly by covering a range of visualizations, including heatmaps, scatter plots, and correlations. It also includes an analysis of a baby dataset to explore factors affecting birth weights and maternal health, as well as exploring of Kepler's third law with planetary data.

## Features
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.
- Heatmaps created to identify nand recognize patterns in data.
- Scatter plot visualization of planetary data in relation to **Kepler's third law**.
- Analysis and visualization of a baby dataset for insights into birth weights and maternal health.

## Usage
To run the notebooks:
- Clone the repository.
- Open the `.ipynb` files using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
- Execute the cells sequentially to perform visualizations and analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `numpy`

## Input
- **Baby Dataset**: Contains information on birth weights, maternal health, and other related factors.
- **Planetary Dataset**: Includes data used to explore and visualize Kepler's third law.

## Output
- Heatmaps and scatter plots to identify patterns and relationships.
- Visual insights into factors affecting birth weight and maternal health.
- Scatter plots and heatmaps related to planetary data and Kepler's third law.

## Notes
- **Baby Dataset Analysis**: Focuses on exploring health data and birth weights.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Demonstrates how to create heatmaps for identifying patterns.
- **Kepler's Third Law**: Uses planetary data to create scatter plots and understand correlations.
